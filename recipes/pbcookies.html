    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's nothing like a peanut butter cookie to satisfy your sweet tooth and lift your spirits. This peanut butter cookie recipe will quickly become a family favorite. </p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics: </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> This peanut butter cookie recipe starts with two sticks of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut butter:</strong> This recipe calls for crunchy peanut butter, but you can use smooth if you'd prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugars:</strong> A blend of white and brown sugars creates the perfect sweet, warm flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binder, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the dough structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Beat the butter, peanut butter, and sugars together. Beat in the eggs. Sift the dry ingredients together, then add to the wet mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll into balls:</strong> Chill the dough to make it easier to work with. Roll the dough into balls, place on a baking sheet, flatten with a fork, and make a criss cross pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> Bake the cookies until golden, then cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
